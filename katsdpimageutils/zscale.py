    Parameters
    ----------
    image
        2D array of float
    max_samples
        Maximum number of samples to return. The actual number returned may be
        less if the image is smaller or if there are non-finite samples (which
        are discarded)
    random_offsets

        it starts from the pixel at (0, 0). Enabling this is useful when
        combining samples from multiple images. If an instance of

    """Determine the minimum/maximum image values for a given contrast.

    This is used to scale a colourmap applied to FITS images when
    saving to alternative image formats or for on screen display.

    It is a Python implementation of the IRAF/ds9 zscale algorithm.
    A description of the zscale algorithm can be found here:
    https://iraf.net/forum/viewtopic.php?showtopic=134139

    This implementation has a few minor changes from IRAF:

      1. Don't default to the full data range if iterations
         reject `max_reject` samplesâ€”use the range determined
         on the final iteration instead.
      2. Use the masked set of samples to work out the image
         median. The masked data should give an answer without
         including source/artefact contributions to the pixel
         distribution.
      3. Addition of a stretch factor to scale the derived
         minimum and maximum. This is applicable to radio
         images, where negative pixel values can cause the
         vanilla IRAF algorithm to display too much of the
         background rumble.

    Parameters
    ----------
    samples
        1D array of pixel values sampled from the full image.
        See :func:`sample_image`.
    contrast
        The scaling factor (between 0 and 1) for determining
        the returned minimum and maximum value. Larger values
        decrease the difference between them.
    stretch
        Scale factor by which to scale the contrasted gradient.
        The minimum value is derived from gradient / stretch
        and the maximum value from gradient * stretch.
    sigma_rej
        Multiple of standard deviation to reject outliers
        while iterating.
    max_iter
        Maximum number of iterations.
    max_reject
        Stop iterating if number of pixels left is less than
        `max_reject` * npix.
    min_npix: int
        Hard limit on the minimum number of pixels allowed in
        the sample and after rejection.

    Returns
    -------
    z1, z2 : float
        Minimum and maximum sample values to be mapped to the extremes
        of a colour map. These will be nans if samples is empty.
